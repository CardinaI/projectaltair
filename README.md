hello! this is my project which i started on the 20th of september and sucessfully finished on 23rd sepetember. 
i just like to mention that prior to working on this project, i had no experience on coding. i have a business background so i had to start learning the basics of html and css. 
i used a learning platform called udemy to get started. the basics of html and css were quite easy to pick up.
i suppose the only main issue i had was deciding the layout of my webpage - im not a very creative person haha. i ended up settling for a column webpage. it's super basic but for a start, it was good enough. 
i started to build my webpage as i watched the lectures on udemy, using a text editor called atom. atom is super friendly as it suggests the tags i might want as i type. it also explains each tag which is super helpful for me. the html tags were relatively easy to pick up. css proved to be quite a struggle. each css element was easy in it ownself to understand, but to put everything together was difficult. i had to google search for help many times.

the libraries i used listed on the webpage helped me tremendously. i started off with the basics on udemy, then moved on to w3schools for more specific element codes. elements like pagination and the videos were done with help from w3schools. I found some pretty fonts from fonts.google. Coolors is a color palette generator which i used to decide the colors of each column on the page. Font awesome was a library of icons which i used for the page. Lastly, stackoverflow helped me to answer any questions i had. 

i do believe i fulfilled all of the basic requirements for this project. 
there are 2 html pages (named page1 and page 2) respectively that you can hop between using the pagination on the bottom of the pages.
the list of libraries is a unordered list itself. the social media column is a table. there is an image on the about me column, as well as the background image. 
videos are on the second page, under songs. i realised that youtube itself was quite friendly, for it automatically provides the embedded code. all i had to do was to copy and paste the code into my html file. 
as for the bonus, i have hosted this project on github. im not very familiar with github, so i hope i did it correctly. you can find my project by searching "cardinal/projectaltair". 

my project mainly revolves around html and css. i didnt focus much on javascript, though the only example of javascript is the alert function when you go to page 2. 

despite all the doubts and frustrations i had while working on this project, it was actually quite fun to learn and build. i wouldnt consider myself an expert, since i still have many things to learn. 

thank you for reading and looking at my project!
